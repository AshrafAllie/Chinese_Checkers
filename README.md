Chinese_Checkers
================

Created a working prototype of a variant of the Chinese Checkers board game. A
command driven program written in C that runs in the Terminal.

The goal is to get 1 bead in the centre of the board. To eliminate a bead use an 
adjacent bead to jump over the intended bead to be eliminated. A bead may only 
jump horizontally or vertically over 1 or more beads provided that there is an 
empty space in front of the bead that is intended to be eliminated.
