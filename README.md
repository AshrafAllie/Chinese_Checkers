Chinese_Checkers
================

I created a working prototype of a variant of the Chinese Checkers board game. A
command driven program written in C that runs in the Terminal.

You have to type in commands to move the cursor "up" "down" "left" and "right". 
Type "tab" to change the current window you are in. Type "select" to select an 
option when in the menu window and select also selects as well as deselects a 
bead when in the main window.  The goal is to get 1 bead in the centre of the 
board. To eliminate a bead use an adjacent bead to jump over the intended bead 
to be eliminated. A bead may only jump horizontally or vertically over 1 or more 
beads provided that there is an empty space in front of the bead that is 
intended to be eliminated.
